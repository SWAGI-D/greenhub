    <p>
        Even if you live in a small apartment or a house with no yard, you can still grow your own herbs, vegetables, and greens. Urban gardening empowers you to eat fresh, save money, and reduce your environmental impact — all from your balcony, windowsill, or rooftop!
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4 text-success">Benefits of Growing Your Own Food</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduces carbon emissions from food transport</li>
        <li>Gives you access to fresh, chemical-free produce</li>
        <li>Promotes mindfulness and eco-conscious living</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="mt-4 text-success">Use Recycled Containers</h4>
    <p>
        You don’t need fancy planters to get started. Repurpose plastic bottles, tin cans, old buckets, and crates to grow herbs like basil or mint. Drill drainage holes and decorate them to add charm.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4 text-success">Try Vertical Gardening</h4>
    <p>
        Maximize limited space by growing vertically. Use wall-mounted racks, hanging planters, or vertical pallet gardens to grow tomatoes, leafy greens, and even strawberries.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4 text-success">Reduce Your Carbon Footprint</h4>
    <p>
        Growing your own produce means fewer plastic-wrapped goods and fewer transportation emissions. Plus, plants improve air quality and bring nature closer to home.
