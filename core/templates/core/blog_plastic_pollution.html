    <h2 class="mb-4">How Plastic Pollution is Destroying Our Oceans</h2>

    <p>
        Plastic pollution is one of the most pressing environmental issues of our time. Every year, millions of tons of plastic waste enter our oceans,
        harming marine life and disrupting ecosystems.
    </p>

    <h4>The Problem</h4>
    <p>
        From plastic bags and bottles to microplastics, synthetic waste ends up in the water due to littering, inefficient waste management,
        and excessive single-use plastic consumption. Marine animals often mistake plastic for food, which leads to injury or death.
    </p>

    <h4>What You Can Do</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Switch to reusable bags, bottles, and containers.</li>
        <li>Avoid products with microbeads.</li>
        <li>Recycle responsibly and reduce overall plastic use.</li>
        <li>Participate in local beach cleanups or community awareness programs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        By making small, conscious changes in our daily lives, we can help protect our oceans and preserve marine life for future generations.
