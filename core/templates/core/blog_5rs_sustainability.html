    <p>
        Living sustainably begins with mindful decisions. The 5 R’s are a practical guide for reducing your environmental impact. Here's how you can start integrating them into your everyday life:
    </p>

    <h4>1. Refuse</h4>
    <p>Say no to single-use plastics, excessive packaging, and freebies that you don’t need. Refusing unnecessary items is the first step to avoiding waste altogether.</p>

    <h4>2. Reduce</h4>
    <p>Be intentional about what you buy and how much you consume. Choose quality over quantity and minimize your use of non-renewable resources.</p>

    <h4>3. Reuse</h4>
    <p>Opt for reusable bags, containers, water bottles, and coffee cups. Giving items a second life before discarding them reduces demand for new products.</p>

    <h4>4. Repurpose</h4>
    <p>Get creative! Turn old jars into plant pots, or transform worn-out clothes into cleaning rags. Repurposing gives new value to otherwise discarded items.</p>

    <h4>5. Recycle</h4>
    <p>Know your local recycling guidelines and sort your waste correctly. Clean your recyclables and avoid contamination to make sure materials are properly processed.</p>
