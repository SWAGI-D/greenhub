  <h2 class="text-success">Why Switching to Green Energy Matters</h2>
  <p>Green energy, derived from renewable sources like solar, wind, and hydro, helps reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, cuts carbon emissions, and combats climate change.</p>
  <p>By adopting clean energy at home and in our communities, we contribute to a healthier planet and sustainable future. Governments and individuals alike play a key role in this energy transition.</p>
  <p>Incentives such as tax rebates, lower utility bills, and energy independence make switching both environmentally and economically beneficial.</p>
  <p>Every switch, whether it's installing solar panels or choosing a green energy provider, counts toward a cleaner Earth. </p>
